2003-??-??  Philip Kendall  <pak21-spectrum@srcf.ucam.org>

	* Various data structures (snapshots, tapes, tape blocks) which
	  were previously directly accessible are now accessible only via
	  wrapper functions. This should improve future binary
	  compatability, but at the cost of breaking it for this release
	  (Philip Kendall).

	* Change the API for reading/writing snapshots to be more general.
	  The old API still exists, but is deprecated (Philip Kendall).

	* Support for reading .szx, .zxs, .sp, .snp and +D snapshots
	  (Philip Kendall).

	* Support for writing .szx and .sna snapshots (Philip Kendall).

	* Support for reading Warajevo .tap files (Fredrick Meunier).

	* Support for signing RZX files with digital signatures (Philip
	  Kendall).

	* Timing fixes for the TC2048 and TC2068 (Fredrick Meunier).

	* Fix reading of 128K .sna snapshots (Philip Kendall).	

	* New capabilities for the Timex dock, and built-in Sinclair and
	  Kempston joysticks (Fredrick Meunier).

	* Use <stdint.h> to give us the <n>-bit types if it's available
	  (Philip Kendall).

	* Ignore links to external snapshots from RZX files, rather than
	  trying to interpret the path as a snapshot (Philip Kendall).

2003-04-27  Philip Kendall  <pak21-spectrum@srcf.ucam.org>

	* Version 0.1.1 released

	* Support reading .z80 snapshots with Spectaculator's 16K, +2 and
	  +2A extensions (Fredrick Meunier).

	* Add routines to get timing information for the various machines
	  (Philip Kendall).

	* TC2068 support, including .z80 snapshots using hardware type 15.
	  (Witold Filipczyk/Fredrick Meunier).

	* Support for Warajevo's .dck files (Darren Salt/Fredrick Meunier).

2002-12-09  Philip Kendall  <pak21-spectrum@srcf.ucam.org>

	* Version 0.1.0 released

	* Major code reorganisation: API changes to allow future binary
	  compatability, logical organisation of header files improved
	  and many other small changes (Philip Kendall)

	* Add ability to output .tap files (Philip Kendall)

	* Add +2, +2A, +3 and TC2048 snapshots (Philip Kendall)

	* Add machine capabilities functions (Philip Kendall)

	* Support for writing compressed snapshots into .rzx files
	  (Darren Salt/Philip Kendall)

	* Win32 systems have _strcmpi but not strcasecmp (thanks, Simon
	  Owen).

	* Add extern "C" around the header file (Simon Owen again).

	* Add libspectrum_identify_file to guess at the format of a file
	  (Philip Kendall).

	* Add some semi-decent documentation in doc/libspectrum.txt
	  (Philip Kendall).

2002-08-08  Philip Kendall  <pak21-spectrum@srcf.ucam.org>

	* libspectrum separated from Fuse just before the 0.5.0 release of
	  Fuse; see Fuse's ChangeLog for changes up to this point
