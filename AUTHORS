Fuse has been brought to you by:

* Matan Ziv-Av: SVGAlib and framebuffer user interfaces, the glib
  replacement code, some work on the sound code and the original
  `widget' code.

* Russell Marks: the generic and OSS-specific sound code, the man page,
  the Kempston joystick emulation and lots of bug reports and fixes.

* Ian Collier: the original ZX Printer emulation (for xz80).

* John Elliott: for lib765, which provides Fuse's emulation of the +3's
  FDC, and libdsk which provides support for more disk image formats:
  see http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/Unix/LibDsk/

* Darren Salt: the original versions of the code for +3 emulation,
  SLT support, MITSHM support (for the Xlib UI), TZX raw data blocks,
  and RZX embedded snapshots and compression.

* Alexander Yurchenko: the OpenBSD/Solaris-specific sound code.

* Fredrick Meunier: for TC2048 support, the SDL user interface as well
  as other bug fixes and the like.

* Philip Kendall: everything else.
