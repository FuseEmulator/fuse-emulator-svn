Fuse has been brought to you by:

* Matan Ziv-Av: SVGAlib and framebuffer user interfaces, the glib
  replacement code, some work on the sound code and the original
  `widget' code.

* Russell Marks: the generic and OSS-specific sound code, the man page,
  the Kempston joystick emulation and lots of bug reports and fixes.

* Ian Collier: the original ZX Printer emulation (for xz80).

* Darren Salt: the original versions of the +3 emulation, the SLT and
  the MITSHM code (for the Xlib UI) and TZX raw data blocks.

* Alexander Yurchenko: the OpenBSD/Solaris-specific sound code.

* Philip Kendall: everything else.
