# Format here is <keysym>, <key1>, <key2>.

# <keysym> should be a Xlib XK_ keysym; keysyms.pl must convert any which
# differ for svgalib

# <key1> and <key2> are two Spectrum keys as defined in keyboard.h (or
# NONE for no key). The widget handlers consider only the first key
# specified, so put the `main' key in as <key1> and the modifier as <key2>
