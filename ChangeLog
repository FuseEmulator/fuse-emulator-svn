	* Version 0.5.0 released

	* Support for RZX v0.12 (Recording/playback code by Philip
	  Kendall, file support by Darren Salt and Philip Kendall).

	* +3 support using John Elliott's lib765 and libdsk libraries
	  (Darren Salt/Philip Kendall).

	* TC2048 support (Fredrick Meunier).

	* Z80 core fixes: timing of OTDR and interrupt routines,
	  R register during interrupt and HALT and contention of

	  rzxtool(1) (Philip Kendall).

	* Support for TZX raw data blocks (Darren Salt).

	  latest version of the auto* tools, XFree86 and GTK+ 1.2
	  installed (Fredrick Meunier).

	* Add an explanation of Fuse's main emulation loop and events
	  system to hacking/implementation_notes.txt

	* Add optional use of 640x480 mode with the SVGAlib UI (Darren
	  Salt/Philip Kendall).

	* Lots of other minor bugfixes (Darren Salt, Russell Marks,

2002-03-26  Philip Kendall  <pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org>

	* Version 0.4.2 released

	* Simple support for a very limited form of RZX files (Philip
	  Kendall).

	* Sound support for OpenBSD and Solaris (Alexander Yurchenko).

	* Use the MIT-SHM extension if available under the Xlib UI
	  (originally from Darren Salt, extensively rewritten by Philip
	  Kendall).

	* A new Options/Sound menu, giving the option to turn sound on
	  and off (Philip Kendall).

	* Under the GTK+ UI, press F1 to get a pop-up main menu (Russell
	  Marks).

	* Add the ability to select which device to use for sound output
	  (Philip Kendall).

	* Create a dialog box when errors occur (idea from Darren Salt,
	  written by Philip Kendall).

	* Titles for the GTK+ UI file selection dialog boxes (Darren
	  Salt).

	* Update the man page (Russell Marks).

	* Fix the segfault which could occur if you pressed Page Down in
	  the file selector widget with less than a full screen of files
	  in (Philip Kendall).

	* Get the R register emulation correct if a DDxx or FDxx
	  instruction doesn't use IX or IY (Philip Kendall).

	* Get the timings of tape edges write (previously, we could be
	  slow by up to (length of last instruction) t-states) (Philip
	  Kendall).

	* Don't write to the printer unless we get a valid stop bit
	  (Russell Marks).

	* Open the sound devices non-blocking to avoid hangs on some
	  systems (reported by Erik Kunze, fixed by Alexander Yurchenko).

	* Don't write SLT data to .z80 files unless some actually exists
	  (reported by Russell Marks, fixed by Philip Kendall).

	* Search a system-wide directory for the ROMs; see Debian's
	  spectrum-roms package for why this will be useful (Philip
	  Kendall).

	* Get the lengths of ROMs correct when munmap(2)ing them (Darren
	  Salt/Philip Kendall).

	* Add a small document describing the preferred coding style for
	  Fuse (Philip Kendall).

2002-02-04  Philip Kendall  <pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org>

	* Version 0.4.1 released.

	* Add contention of memory and io ports. Should make multicolour
	  effects better (Philip Kendall).

	  more games (eg Sidewize) work (Philip Kendall).

	* Add a keyboard picture -- see the Help menu (Philip Kendall,
	  Russell Marks).

	* Support for .slt files (Philip Kendall, Darren Salt).

	* Support for the ZX Printer (48K), serial printer (128K/+2)
	  and parallel printer (+2A) (Russell Marks).

	* Add the ability to select a machine type directly, rather than
	  cycling through the available machines (Philip Kendall).

	* Add command-line options; see the man page for details (Philip
	  Kendall).

	* Lots of improvements to the widgets to make them much more
	  similar to the GTK+ menus (Philip Kendall).

	* Cleaner shutdown on 'impossible' conditions; especially useful
	  with the SVGAlib UI (Philip Kendall).

	* Make tzxlist able to deal with multiple files, and give it
	  a man page (Darren Salt).

	* Man page update (Russell Marks).

	* Remove coredump if an empty .tzx file was loaded (Philip Kendall).

	* Various bits of codebase reorganisation. Most significant is the
	  move of each UI to its own directory (Philip Kendall).

	* Fix a fairly major thinko in libspectrum which meant that it
	  was using approximately twice as much memory as it needed to
	  (Philip Kendall).

	* Things probably of more interest to developers:
	  + A --enable-warnings option to configure to turn on lots more
	    warning options if you're using gcc.
	  + Detect gcc properly in configure.in.
	  + Remove many of the warnings generated when --enable-warnings
	    is used.
	  + Add a hacking/ui.txt file giving details on how to implement
	    a new UI for Fuse.
	  (Philip Kendall).

2001-12-20  Philip Kendall  <pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org>

	* The big one: .tzx support. Fuse will now read in all the common
	  block types from .tzx files (Philip Kendall).

	* Ability to write out tape files (Philip Kendall).

	* Various improvements to the widget dialog boxes: cursor keys,
	  Page Up, Page Down, Home and End all do what you would expect,
	  remove the use of `scandir' function to improve inter-Unix
	  compatability, append `/' to directories to make them more
	  obvious, stop the hangs if you tried to start a widget whilst
	  one was active. (Philip Kendall, Russell Marks).

	* .z80 snapshots: deal with the case of the end marker being
	  preceeded by 0x00 or 0x00 0xed (Philip Kendall).

2001-10-07  Philip Kendall  <pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org>

	* Versions 0.3.2 and 0.3.2.1 released.

	* Added file selection dialog boxes for snapshot and tape loading,
	  and (GTK+ only) snapshot saving (Philip Kendall, Matan Ziv-Av).

	* Allowed changing of Issue 2/3 keyboard at run-time. (Philip
	  Kendall).
	
	* Basically complete rewrite of the tape handling routines (Philip
	  Kendall).

	* Allow `slow' tape loading with border effects, sound, et al.
	  (Philip Kendall).

	* Changed the default install location to `/usr/local' (Philip
 	  Kendall).

	* Generate keysyms.c from keysyms.dat; allows me automatically 
	  keep the Xlib/GTK+ and svgalib key tables in sync (Philip
	  Kendall).

	* Beginnings of `widgets': dialog boxes etc. for non-GTK+ user
  	  interfaces (Matan Ziv-Av, Philip Kendall).

2001-08-13  Philip Kendall  <pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org>

	* Version 0.3.1 released.

	* Removed need for glib (but it's still used if present)
	  (Matan Ziv-Av).

	* Separated OSS (Linux) specific sound code out into separate
	  files, removed most floating-point calculations from the AY
	  code, added support for 16-bit only devices, and added some
	  AY subsampling (Russell Marks).

	* Fuse now runs on a StrongARM 1110, using the new framebuffer
	  UI (Matan Ziv-Av).
	
	* Major tidy-up of display.c and event.c (Philip Kendall).

	* Implemented a `lazy write' scheme for the screen. Makes
	  rainbowing effects _much_ faster (and helps elsewhere as
	  well) (Philip Kendall).

	* Further improvements to the lazy write scheme - consecutive
	  lines which have changed are copied to the screen in one
	  block, rather than as separate lines (Philip Kendall).

	* Complete rewrite of the snapshot code; now handles .z80
	  and .sna snapshots (Philip Kendall).

	* Started separating some bits of code into subdirectories;
	  currently `libspectrum' for the snapshot code, and `z80'
	  for the Z80 core (Philip Kendall).

	* Added `AUTHORS' file (Philip Kendall).

	* Large rewrite of the code for changing machine type
	  (Philip Kendall).

	* Made `make install' work (Philip Kendall).

	* Version 0.3.0 released.

	* Fixed a large bug in the 48K snapshot saving routine.

	* Added rudimentary GTK+ interface.

	* Added svgalib interface (thanks to Matan Ziv-Av).

	* Made peripheral emulation much more modular, and added proper
	  decoding of ports.

	* Fixing timings for INI, OUTI, IND, OUTD and the repeated
	  versions (they were all one T-state too short).

	* Sound support under Linux (thanks to Russell Marks and Matan
	  Ziv-Av).

	* Version 0.2.1 released.

	* 2x2 and 3x3 displays now available.

	* Border emulation is back (with rainbowing).

	* Better keyboard emulation -- Abu Simbel Profanation now works
	  (and Issue 2 emulation is now available as a compile-time
	  option). Thanks to Santiago Romero for putting me on the track
	  of this bug.

	* Rewrite of Z80 core: one function call now runs the Z80 core
	  until something interesting happens, as determined by a list of
	  `events'. Thanks to Miklos Szeredi's `SpectEmu' for the
	  inspiration for this change.

2000-09-27  Philip Kendall  <pak@ast.cam.ac.uk>
