2003-??-??  Philip Kendall  <pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org>

	* Version 0.6.0 released.

	* Add functionality to `tzxconv' to read and write both .tzx and
	  .tap; hence rename it to `tapeconv'.

	* Stop `rzxtool' accessing unallocated memory when adding a
	  snapshot to an RZX file.

	* Add `scl2trd' utility to convert .scl files to .trd files
	  (Fredrick Meunier).

	* Add `listbasic' utility to extract the BASIC listing from a
	  snapshot or tape file. Heavily based on Chris Cowley's SnapList,
	  http://freestuff.grok.co.uk/snaplist/index.html (Philip Kendall).
