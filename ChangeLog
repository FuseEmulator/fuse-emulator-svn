	* Added +2A emulation.

	* spec128.c (spec128_writebyte): The screen wasn't being updated
	  it was written to when not in the 0x4000-0x7fff position.

1999-08-20  Philip Kendall  <pak21@cam.ac.uk>

	* Make hardware emulation more modular

1999-08-19  Philip Kendall  <pak21@cam.ac.uk>

	* fuse.c (fuse_init): Console version now throws away
	  suid root privileges after initialising Allegro

	* snapshot.c: Can now save snapshots with the F2 key

	* display.c (display_frame): Made flash happen every 16 frames,
	  not 25

	* Rainbowing effects now emulated (screen only, not border)

	* timer.c: Made signal handling POSIX compliant (Thanks to
	  Erik Kunze again)

	* Made the console version run at the correct speed (almost. It
	  runs at 50.00Hz, rather than the correct 50.01Hz (128K/+2) or
	  50.08Hz (48K) ).

1999-08-18  Philip Kendall  <pak21@cam.ac.uk>

	* z80_macros.h (SBC16): Removed the optimisation as it was wrong.

	* Added ROM trap to read from tape files

1999-08-03  Philip Kendall  <pak21@cam.ac.uk>

	* Version 0.1.2 released.

	* Added support for running on the Linux console (Thanks here go
	  to Thomas Harte). Console version does not eat up 100% of CPU
	  time :-)

	* Thanks to Erik Kunze for some helpful suggestions.

1999-07-22  Philip Kendall  <pak21@cam.ac.uk>

	* Added +2 emulation (Just 128K emulation with different ROMs!)
	
	* spec128.c (spec128_init): 
	* spec48.c (spec48_init): 
	* spectrum.h (machine_info): 
	* spectrum.c (spectrum_set_timings): 
	* timer.c (timer_delay): Add support for variable processor
	  speeds. 128K machines now run at 3.54690 MHz

	* fuse.c (main): z80 reset handled by machine.reset(),
	  so no need to call it separately.

	* z80.c (z80_reset): Z80 reset turns off halt state

	* z80_macros.h (SBC16): Small optimisation

	* display.c: Flashing characters implemented

1999-07-21  Philip Kendall  <pak21@cam.ac.uk>

	* display.c (display_get_attr):
	  (display_plot8):
	  (display_plot64_addr): ink and paper are now of type BYTE rather
 	  than int.

	* z80_macros.h (CP): Set the S flag (and a small optimisation)

	* fuse.c (fuse_init): 
	* display.c (display_init): Made sure allegro_init() was called
	  before install_timer(). (Thanks to Thomas Harte)

	* keyboard.c (keyboard_data): Removed KEY_CONTROL entry as
	  KEY_CONTROL and KEY_LCONTROL are the same thing.

1999-07-19  Philip Kendall  <pak21@cam.ac.uk>

	* Version 0.1.1 released.

	* Makefile.am: Include spec128.h in the distribution so it compiles

	* keyboard.c: Moved the keyboard initialisation from display.c (!)

	* display.c, spec48.c, spec128.c: Added border emulation

	* z80_ddfdcb.c: Documented rotates/shifts now write the changed
	  byte back again.

	* Changed file permissions on *.rom, COPYING.
	
	* ay.h: Added `extern' in front of the declarations.

	* z80.h, z80_ed.c, z80_macros.h, z80_ops.c: Add R register emulation.

	* README: Fix WoS download link.

1999-07-18  Philip Kendall  <pak21@cam.ac.uk>

	* Version 0.1.0 released.
