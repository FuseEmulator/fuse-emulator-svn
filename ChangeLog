2001-09-xx  Philip Kendall  <pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org>

	* Added file selection dialog boxes for snapshot opening and
	  closing, and opening tape files. GTK+ only (Philip Kendall).

	* Allowed changing of Issue 2/3 keyboard at run-time. There's only
	  any way of changing this if you're using GTK+ at the moment,
	  though (Philip Kendall).
	
	* Basically complete rewrite of the tape handling routines (Philip
 	  Kendall).

	* Allow `slow' tape loading with border effects, sound, et al.
	  The code should work for all user interfaces, but there's no
	  way of turning off the tape traps unless you're using GTK+ at
	  the moment (Philip Kendall).

	* Changed the default install location to `/usr/local' (Philip
 	  Kendall).

	* Generate keysyms.c from keysyms.dat; allows me automatically 
	  keep the Xlib/GTK+ and svgalib key tables in sync (Philip
	  Kendall).

	* Beginnings of `widgets': dialog boxes etc. for non-GTK+ user
  	  interfaces (Matan Ziv-Av, Philip Kendall).

2001-08-13  Philip Kendall  <pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org>

	* Version 0.3.1 released.

	* Removed need for glib (but it's still used if present)
	  (Matan Ziv-Av).

	* Separated OSS (Linux) specific sound code out into separate
	  files, removed most floating-point calculations from the AY
	  code, added support for 16-bit only devices, and added some
	  AY subsampling (Russell Marks).

	* Fuse now runs on a StrongARM 1110, using the new framebuffer
	  UI (Matan Ziv-Av).
	
	* Major tidy-up of display.c and event.c (Philip Kendall).

	* Implemented a `lazy write' scheme for the screen. Makes
	  rainbowing effects _much_ faster (and helps elsewhere as
	  well) (Philip Kendall).

	* Further improvements to the lazy write scheme - consecutive
	  lines which have changed are copied to the screen in one
	  block, rather than as separate lines (Philip Kendall).

	* Complete rewrite of the snapshot code; now handles .z80
	  and .sna snapshots (Philip Kendall).

	* Started separating some bits of code into subdirectories;
	  currently `libspectrum' for the snapshot code, and `z80'
	  for the Z80 core (Philip Kendall).

	* Added `AUTHORS' file (Philip Kendall).

	* Large rewrite of the code for changing machine type
	  (Philip Kendall).

	* Made `make install' work (Philip Kendall).

2001-01-31  Philip Kendall  <pak@ast.cam.ac.uk>

	* Version 0.3.0 released.

	* Fixed a large bug in the 48K snapshot saving routine.

	* Added rudimentary GTK+ interface.

	* Added svgalib interface (thanks to Matan Ziv-Av).

	* Made peripheral emulation much more modular, and added proper
	  decoding of ports.

	* Fixing timings for INI, OUTI, IND, OUTD and the repeated
	  versions (they were all one T-state too short).

	* Sound support under Linux (thanks to Russell Marks and Matan
	  Ziv-Av).

2000-12-17  Philip Kendall  <pak@ast.cam.ac.uk>

	* Version 0.2.1 released.

	* 2x2 and 3x3 displays now available.

	* Border emulation is back (with rainbowing).

	* Better keyboard emulation -- Abu Simbel Profanation now works
	  (and Issue 2 emulation is now available as a compile-time
	  option). Thanks to Santiago Romero for putting me on the track
	  of this bug.

	* Rewrite of Z80 core: one function call now runs the Z80 core
	  until something interesting happens, as determined by a list of
	  `events'. Thanks to Miklos Szeredi's `SpectEmu' for the
	  inspiration for this change.

2000-09-27  Philip Kendall  <pak@ast.cam.ac.uk>

	* Version 0.2.0 released

	* Lots of other changes as well.

	* Loads of changes to remove Allegro and replace it with Xlib calls.

1999-08-22  Philip Kendall  <pak@ast.cam.ac.uk>

	* Version 0.1.3 released.

	* Added +2A emulation.

	* Can now save snapshots.

	* Screen rainbowing effects present.

	* Console version runs at the correct speed (almost. It runs at
	  50.00Hz, rather than the correct 50.01Hz (128K/+2) or 50.08Hz
	  (48K) ).

	* Added ROM trap to read from tape files.

	* Other bug fixes/improvements.

1999-08-03  Philip Kendall  <pak@ast.cam.ac.uk>

	* Version 0.1.2 released.

	* Added support for running on the Linux console (Thanks here go
	  to Thomas Harte). Console version does not eat up 100% of CPU
	  time :-)

	* Added +2 emulation (Just 128K emulation with different ROMs!)
	
	* Flashing characters implemented.

	* Bug fixes/improvements (Thanks to Erik Kunze for some helpful
 	  suggestions)

1999-07-19  Philip Kendall  <pak@ast.cam.ac.uk>

	* Version 0.1.1 released.

	* Added border emulation.

1999-07-18  Philip Kendall  <pak@ast.cam.ac.uk>

	* Version 0.1.0 released.
