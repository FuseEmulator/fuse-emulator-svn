.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.RI "\-t " type
causes
.I type
to be used as the level detection trigger. There are two triggers implemented;
the
.I simple
trigger just uses a threshold value to convert to a one or zero on output, and
the
.I schmitt
trigger implements a Schmitt trigger which outputs a less noisy signal, but
requires a stronger signal to noise ratio than the simple trigger. The default
trigger is "simple".
.TP
\-s
causes the display of a frequency graph showing the sound levels present in the
audio file. This can be useful when selecting good crossover points.
.TP
.RI "\-p " level
causes
.I level
to be used as the crossover point between a level of one or zero in the tape
file output in the simple trigger. The default level is 127 from a range of
0-255.
.TP
.RI "\-h " level
causes
.I level
to be used as the low to high crossover point between a level of one or zero
in the tape file output for the Schmitt trigger. The default level is 195 from a
range of 0-255.
.TP
.RI "\-l " level
causes
.I level
to be used as the high to low crossover point between a level of one or zero
in the tape file output for the Schmitt trigger. The default level is 60 from a
range of 0-255.
.TP
.I infile
specifies the audio file to be converted. This file can be in any of the
tape formats supported by
.IR libaudiofile .
.TP
.I outfile
specifies the output tape file. The format will be determined by the
file extension and can be in any of the formats
.IR libspectrum "(3)"
supports for output.
