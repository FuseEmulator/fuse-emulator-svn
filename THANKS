Some thanks (in alphabetical order):

* Michael Bukin: for XWinAllegro, which was used by previous versions of
  Fuse for the graphical display.
  (http://www.canvaslink.com/allegro/xwinallegro/)

* Ian Collier: the source to his xz80
  (http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/users/ian.collier/Spectrum/index.html)
  was very helpful for getting the z80 opcodes right.

* Shawn Hargreaves: for Allegro (http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/)
  (again, used by previous versions of Fuse for the graphical display)

* Thomas Harte: for the much faster console display routines (Not present
  in the current version).

* Erik Kunze: for lots of helpful hints on how to program under Unix.

* Gerton Lunter: his wonderful z80
  (ftp://ftp.void.jump.org/pub/sinclair/emulators/pc/dos/z80-400.zip)
  got me started on this emulation lark all those years ago...

* Russell Marks: for the beeper/AY emulation, and the Linux specific sound
  code.

* Santiago Romero: for putting me on the track of a bug in Fuse's keyboard
  emulation.

* Miklos Szeredi: his `SpectEmu' (http://www.inf.bme.hu/~mszeredi/spectemu/)
  gave the inspiration for an important rewrite of the Z80 core, and was
  also _very_ useful whilst trying to track down some bugs.

* Martijn van der Heide: for World of Spectrum (http://www.void.jump.org/)
  -- simply the best Speccy Web site out there.

* Matan Ziv-Av: for adding svgalib (http://www.svgalib.org/) support to
  Fuse, some work on the sound code and the replacement functions used
  if glib isn't available.
