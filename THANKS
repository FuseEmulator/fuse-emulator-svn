Some thanks (in alphabetical order):

* Michael Bukin: for XWinAllegro, which was used by previous versions of
  Fuse for the graphical display.
  (http://www.canvaslink.com/allegro/xwinallegro/)

* Ian Collier: the source to his xz80
  (http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/users/ian.collier/Spectrum/index.html)
  was very helpful for getting the z80 opcodes right; also the ZX Printer
  emulation is based on xz80's.

* Boris Donko: for spotting that I'd forgotten memory contention on the
  LD (nnnn),A instruction.

* John Elliott: for lib765, which provides Fuse's emulation of the +3's
  FDC: see http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/Unix/LibDsk/

* Ian Greenway: for information about reading from unattached ports. If
  you've got an Amiga, you may well like to check out Ian's Spectrum
  Emulator, ASp: http://www.greew.freeserve.co.uk/ASp.html

* Shawn Hargreaves: for Allegro (http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/)
  (again, used by previous versions of Fuse for the graphical display)

* Thomas Harte: for the much faster console display routines (Not present
  in the current version).

* Erik Kunze: for lots of helpful hints on how to program under Unix.

* Gerton Lunter: his wonderful z80
  (ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/emulators/pc/dos/z80-400.zip)
  got me started on this emulation lark all those years ago...

* Anders Holmberg: for reporting a bug in the z80 v1.45 load routines. Anders
  has done what is basically a port of Fuse 0.4.0 to the PocketPC: see
  http://pocketclive.emuunlim.com/.

* Russell Marks: for various bits of code (see `AUTHORS')

* Fredrick Meunier: for TC2048 support and more (see `AUTHORS')

* Santiago Romero: for putting me on the track of a bug in Fuse's keyboard
  emulation.

* Darren Salt: some bits of code (see `AUTHORS')

* Miklos Szeredi: his `SpectEmu' (http://www.inf.bme.hu/~mszeredi/spectemu/)
  gave the inspiration for an important rewrite of the Z80 core, and was
  also _very_ useful whilst trying to track down some bugs.

* Martijn van der Heide: for World of Spectrum
  (http://www.worldofspectrum.org/) -- simply the best Speccy Web site out
  there.

* Mark Woodmass: for putting me on the track of (and finding the
  solution to) bugs with regard to Fuse's R register emulation during
  HALTs and interrupts. Mark's another one who's written an emulator:
  see http://www.geocities.com/specemu/.

* Alexander Yurchenko: for the OpenBSD/Solaris sound code (see `AUTHORS')

* Matan Ziv-Av: for various bits of code (see `AUTHORS')
