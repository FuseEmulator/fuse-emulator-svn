fuse-emulator (0.9.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't use --datadir, as it didn't work.
  * Use dpatch, and add patches:
    - 01-configure.dpatch: rename fuse to fuse-emulator.
    - 01-noroms: don't distribute the ROMs, as they are non-free.
    - 01-man: rename fuse to fuse-emulator in the man page.
  * Add build-dependencies on dpatch, flex and bison.
  * Make fuse-emulator-common depend on fuse-emulator-roms.
  * Remove the reference to the non-free ROMs from the package
    description for fuse-emulator-common.
