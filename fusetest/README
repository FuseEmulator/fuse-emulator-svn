This program is intended to be an automatic regression test suite for
Fuse, although it is designed to be easy for other purposes.

Additional tests can be added to the `_testdata' array in
fusetest.asm. Each test has a null-terminated description (which will
simply be printed) and the address of a routine to call to run that
test.

The routine should return with the zero flag set if the test passes,
and with the zero flag reset if it fails. In the case of failure, the
value of the A register will be dumped to give some form of
diagnostic.
