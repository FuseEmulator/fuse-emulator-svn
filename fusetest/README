This program is intended to be an automatic regression test suite for
Fuse, although it is designed to be easy for other purposes.

Additional tests can be added to the `_testdata' array in
fusetest.asm. Each test has a null-terminated description (which will
simply be printed), a bitfield indicating which machines this test
should be for (bit 0 = 48K, 1 = 128K, 2 = +3, 3 = Pentagon) and the
address of a routine to call to run that test.

The routine should return with the zero flag set if the test passes,
and with the zero flag reset if it fails. In the case of failure:

* If B is non-zero, the test will be reported as "incomplete" and the
  value of B will be dumped
* If B is zero, the test will be reported as "failed" and the value
  of A will be dumped
