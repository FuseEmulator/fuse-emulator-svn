The Free Unix Spectrum Emulator (Fuse) 0.10.0.1
===============================================

Fuse (the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator) was originally, and somewhat
unsurprisingly, an emulator of the ZX Spectrum (a popular 1980s home
computer, especially in the UK) for Unix. However, it has now also
been ported to Mac OS X, which may or may not count as a Unix variant
depending on your advocacy position and Windows which definitely isn't
a Unix variant. Fuse also emulates some of the better-known ZX Spectrum
clones as well.

What Fuse does have:

* Accurate Spectrum 16K/48K/128K/+2/+2A/+3 emulation.
* Working Spectrum +3e and SE, Timex TC2048, TC2068 and TS2068,
  Pentagon 128, "512" (Pentagon 128 with extra memory) and 1024 and
  Scorpion ZS 256 emulation.
* Runs at true Speccy speed on any computer you're likely to try it on.
* Support for loading from .tzx files, including accelerated loading.
* Sound (on systems supporting the Open Sound System, SDL, or OpenBSD/
  Solaris's /dev/audio).
* Emulation of most of the common joysticks used on the Spectrum
  (including Kempston, Sinclair and Cursor joysticks).
* Emulation of some of the printers you could attach to a Spectrum.
* Support for the RZX input recording file format, including
  rollback and 'competition mode'.
* Emulation of the DivIDE, Interface I, Kempston mouse, Spectrum +3e,
  ZXATASP, ZXCF, Beta 128, Opus Discovery and +D interfaces.

Help! <xyz> doesn't work
------------------------

If you're having a problem using/running/building Fuse, the two places
you're most likely to get help are the development mailing list
<fuse-emulator-devel@lists.sf.net> or the official forums at
<http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=91293>.

What you'll need to run Fuse
----------------------------

Unix, Linux, BSD, etc.

Required:

* X, SDL, svgalib or framebuffer support. If you have GTK+, you'll get
  a (much) nicer user interface under X.
* libspectrum: this is available from
  http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/libspectrum.php

Optional:

* Other libraries will give you some extended functionality:
  * libgcrypt: the ability to digitally sign input recordings (note that
    Fuse requires version 1.1.42 or later).
  * libpng: the ability to save screenshots
  * libxml2: the ability to load and save Fuse's current configuration
  * zlib: support for compressed RZX files

If you've used Fuse prior to version 0.5.0, note that the external
utilities (tzxlist, etc) are now available separately from Fuse
itself. See http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/ for details.

Mac OS X

* Either the native port by Fredrick Meunier, or the original version
  will compile on OS X 10.3 (Panther) or later.

Windows

* The Win32 and SDL UIs can be used under Windows, but the Win32 UI is
  incomplete.

Building Fuse
-------------

To compile Fuse (see below for instructions for the OS X native port):

$ ./configure

There are now some options you can give to configure; `configure
--help' will list them all, but the most important are:

--with-fb		Use the framebuffer interface, rather than GTK+.
--with-sdl		Use the SDL interface, rather than GTK+.
--with-svgalib		Use the SVGAlib interface.
--without-gtk		Use the plain Xlib interface.

If glib is installed on your system, Fuse will use this for a couple
of things; however, it isn't necessary as libspectrum provides
replacements for all the routines used by Fuse.

Another useful option is `--with-local-prefix=DIRECTORY' which allows
you to specify that you have some the the libraries needed by Fuse in
`<DIRECTORY>/lib' and the necessary header files in
`<DIRECTORY>/include'. If you specify the `--prefix' option to tell
Fuse to install itself somewhere other than in /usr/local, that
directory will automatically be searched as well.

Then just:

$ make

and then

$ make install

if you want to place Fuse into the main directories on your system
(under /usr/local by default, although you can change this with the
--prefix argument to 'configure'). You'll probably need to be root to
do this bit.

Once you've got Fuse configured and built, read the man page :-)

Note that if you're using version of Fuse from Subversion rather than
one of the released tarballs, you'll need to run `autogen.sh' before
running 'configure' for the first time.

Building the OS X version of Fuse
---------------------------------

The native Cocoa port by Fredrick Meunier <fredm@spamcop.net> comes as
a set of Xcode projects for libgcrypt, libspectrum and Fuse itself.

Building the Wii version of Fuse
--------------------------------

You'll need to have the standard Wii homebrew toolchain installed; see
eg <http://wiibrew.org/wiki/DevkitPro> for some information on setting
this up.

After that, make sure the dev tools are in your path (export
PATH=$PATH:$DEVKITPPC/bin) and that a Wii version of libspectrum has been
built and installed.

Then, use this configure line:

./configure --target=powerpc-gekko --host=powerpc-gekko \
	    --with-wii \
	    --without-libxml2 --without-libiconv --without-gpm \
	    --without-x --without-glib \
	    CFLAGS="-g -I$DEVKITPPC/include -I$DEVKITPRO/libogc/include -DGEKKO" \
	    LDFLAGS="-g -mrvl -mcpu=750 -meabi -mhard-float \
                     -Wl,-Map,fuse.elf.map -L$DEVKITPPC/lib \
                     -L$DEVKITPRO/libogc/lib/wii" \
            LIBS="-lfat -lwiiuse -lbte -logc -lm"

Finally, to build, use this line:

EXEEXT=".elf" make -e

This should build fuse.elf, which you can run on your Wii via the usual
methods.

Building the Win32 version of Fuse on Linux
--------------------------------

You'll need to have the standard MinGW programming tool set. e.g. on Debian
`apt-get install mingw32 mingw-binutils mingw32-runtime'
 <http://www.mingw.org/>

First, have to compile libspectrum:

./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --without-libaudiofile --without-zlib \
	    --without-libgcrypt --without-bzip2 --without-glib --prefix=`pwd`
make install

This should compile libspectrum without any external lib, and `install' into the
source directory. All of the external libs needed by libspectrum and fuse
compile with successfully with MingGW environment - in case of problems
with compiling any of the libs please refer to the lib's homepage for help.

Then, compile fuse:

./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --without-glib --prefix=`pwd` \
	    --with-libspectrum-prefix=`pwd`/../libspectrum --with-win32 \
	    --without-libxml2 --without-x
make

You have to use the real path of libspectrum with `--with-libspectrum-prefix='.
This should build `fuse.exe' without any external lib, but you can run it on
Windows or Linux (with Wine).

Note: you need `libspectrum-7.dll' and the `roms' directory and the `lib'
  directory to `fuse' run perfectly. You may copy this file and directories
  into that directory where `fuse.exe' exists. On windows you may need to
  copy all files from `lib/uncompressed' into `lib'.
  With wine you need `fltmgr.sys' in Windows `system32' directory. (e.g.:
  ~/.wine/c_drive/windows/system32).

Closing comments
----------------

Fuse has its own home page, which you can find at:

announcements) are distributed via the fuse-emulator-announce mailing
list on SourceForge; see
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fuse-emulator-announce

If you've got any bug reports, suggestions or the like for Fuse, or
just want to get involved in the development, this is coordinated via
the fuse-emulator-devel mailing list,
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fuse-emulator-devel
and the Fuse project page on SourceForge,
