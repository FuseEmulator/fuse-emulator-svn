The Free Unix Spectrum Emulator (Fuse) 0.4.0
============================================

Given the current proliferation of DOS/Windows Speccy emulators, I
decided it was time to redress the Unix balance a bit. Therefore, here
is Fuse (the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator), version 0.4.0.

What Fuse does have:

* Working 48K/128K/+2/+2A Speccy emulation, running at true Speccy
  speed on any computer you're likely to try it on (it runs at full
  speed on a SparcStation 4 unless you do too much graphics intensive
  stuff).
* Support for loading from .tzx files.
* Sound (on systems supporting the Open Sound System).
* Kempston joystick emulation.

What Fuse doesn't have:

* Emulation of any other peripherals (bar the tape deck)
* A keyboard picture, so you can find those keywords
* ...

What you'll need to run Fuse:

* A version of Unix with either X or svgalib. If you have GTK+
  installed, you'll get a nicer user interface under X.

To compile Fuse:

$ ./configure

There are now some options you can give to configure; `configure
--help' will list them all, but the most important are:

--with-svgalib		Use the SVGAlib interface, rather than GTK+.
--without-gtk		Use the plain Xlib interface, rather than GTK+.

If glib is installed on your system, Fuse will use this for a couple
of things; however, it isn't necessary (unless you're using the GTK+
interface, as GTK+ depends on glib). If you're having problem with
your glib setup, you can use the `--without-glib' option to
`configure', which will use some simple replacement routines.

On a FreeBSD system, you may have to do

$ GTK_CONFIG=`which gtk12-config` GLIB_CONFIG=`which glib12-config` ./configure

if you want to use either GTK+ or glib.

Then just:

$ make

(or `gmake' if that's what GNU Make is called on your system)

and then

$ make install

if you want to place Fuse into the main directories on your system
(under /usr/local by default, although you can change this with the
--prefix argument to `configure'). You'll probably need to be root to
do this bit.

To run fuse:

$ fuse [snapshot]

Not too difficult. For everything after that,

$ man fuse

is your friend.

Fuse is copyrighted under the GNU General Public License (see the file
`COPYING' for details). However, note the GPL does *not* apply to the
Spectrum ROM files (`128-?.rom', `48.rom', `plus2-?.rom' and
`plus3-?.rom'), which are still copyrighted to Amstrad, although their
free distribution with emulators is permitted.

If you have any bug reports, suggestions or (particularly
appreciated!) patches for Fuse, mail them to me at
pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org. For more general Speccy related discussions,
visit the Usenet group `comp.sys.sinclair', but do read the FAQ
(http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/cssfaq/index.html) first!

Fuse has its own home page, which you can find at:

or the latest version should be available from the World of Spectrum
(http://www.worldofspectrum.org/) FTP site:
