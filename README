libspectrum 0.1.0
=================

libspectrum is a library which is designed to make the input and
output of ZX Spectrum emulator files slightly easier than it would be
otherwise. It should hopefully compile and run on Unix-based systems,
Win32 and Mac OS X.

Currently supported are (both read and write unless stated):

* Input recording files
  * RZX
* Snapshots
  * SNA (read only)
  * Z80
* Tape images
  * TAP (`Z80' format, rather than Warajevo format)
  * TZX

On Unix and Mac OS X, compiling libspectrum should just be as easy as

$ ./configure
$ make

and then `make install' should install it in `/usr/local' ready for
use on your system. If you want to install it somewhere other than
`/usr/local', give the `--prefix=DIR' option to `configure' to install
it under `DIR'. If you do this, you may then have to play about with
`ldconfig' and/or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' to get things to find it. Ask your
local guru.

For details on the functions available, see `doc/libspectrum.txt'.
