The Free Unix Spectrum Emulator (Fuse) 0.5.0
============================================

Given the current proliferation of DOS/Windows Speccy emulators, I
decided it was time to redress the Unix balance a bit. Therefore, here
is Fuse (the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator), version 0.5.0.

What Fuse does have:

* Working 48K/128K/+2/+2A/+3 Speccy and Timex TC2048 emulation,
  running at true Speccy speed on any computer you're likely to try it
  on.
* Support for loading from .tzx files.
* Sound (on systems supporting the Open Sound System, or something
  like OpenBSD or Solaris's /dev/audio).
* Kempston joystick emulation.
* Emulation of some of the printers you could attach to a Spectrum.
* Support for the new RZX input recording file format.

What Fuse doesn't have:

* Emulation of any other peripherals (bar the tape deck)
* ...

What you'll need to run Fuse:

* A version of Unix with either X or svgalib. If you have GTK+
  installed, you'll get a nicer user interface under X.
* If you want +3 support, you'll need John Elliott's lib765 installed;
  this is available from http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/Unix/LibDsk/
  If you also have libdsk (from the same location) installed, you'll also
  get support for extended .dsk files (see 'THE .DSK FORMAT' section in
  fuse(1) for more details on this).

To compile Fuse:

$ ./configure

There are now some options you can give to configure; `configure
--help' will list them all, but the most important are:

--with-svgalib		Use the SVGAlib interface, rather than GTK+.
--without-gtk		Use the plain Xlib interface, rather than GTK+.

If glib is installed on your system, Fuse will use this for a couple
of things; however, it isn't necessary (unless you're using the GTK+
interface, as GTK+ depends on glib). If you're having problem with
your glib setup, you can use the `--without-glib' option to
`configure', which will use some simple replacement routines.

Then just:

$ make

(or `gmake' if that's what GNU Make is called on your system)

and then

$ make install

if you want to place Fuse into the main directories on your system
(under /usr/local by default, although you can change this with the
--prefix argument to `configure'). You'll probably need to be root to
do this bit.

Once you've got Fuse configured and built, read the man page :-)

If you have any bug reports, suggestions or (particularly
appreciated!) patches for Fuse, mail them to me at
pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org. For more general Speccy related discussions,
visit the Usenet group `comp.sys.sinclair', but do read the FAQ
( http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/cssfaq/index.html ) first!

Fuse has its own home page, which you can find at:

http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/spectrum/fuse.html

or the latest version should be available from the World of Spectrum
( http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ ) FTP site:

ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/emulators/unix/

Finally, if you're interested in working on Fuse, some documents which
may be useful (information on internals, etc) are in the hacking/
directory.
