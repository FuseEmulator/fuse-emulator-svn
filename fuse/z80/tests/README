File formats
============

.in files
---------

AF BC DE HL AF' BC' DE' HL' IX IY SP PC
I R IFF1 IFF2 <halted> <tstates>

<halted> specifies whether the Z80 is halted.
<tstates> specifies the number of tstates to run the test for.

Then followed by lines specifying the initial memory setup. Each has
the format:

<start address> <byte1> <byte2> ... -1

eg

1234 56 78 9a -1

says to put 0x56 at 0x1234, 0x78 at 0x1235 and 0x9a at 0x1236.

.out files
----------

A list of 'events': each has the format

<time> <type> <address> <data>

<time> is simply the time at which the event occurs.
<type> is one of MR (memory read), MW (memory write), MC (memory
       contend), PR (port read), PW (port write) or PC (port contend).
<address> is the address (or IO port) affected.
<data> is the byte written or read. Missing for contentions.

After that, lines specifying AF, BC etc as for .in files. <tstates>
now specifies the final time.

After that, lines specifying which bits of memory have changed since
the initial setup. Same format as for .in files.

Why some specific tests are here
================================

37_{1,2,3}: check the behaviour of SCF with respect to bits 3 and 5
	    (bug fixed on 20040225).

cb{4,5,6,7}{7,f}_1: check that bits 3 and 5 are copied to F only
		    for BIT 3,<arg> and BIT 5,<arg> respectively (bug
		    fixed on 20040225).

d{3,b}_{1,2,3}: check for correct port contention on IO in the four
	        relevant states (port high byte in 0x40 to 0x7f or not,
		port low bit set or reset).
