What you need to implement for Fuse's timing routines
=====================================================

Fuse's timing routines require four functions to be implemented, and
'timer_type' to be defined in timer.h as a type appropriate for the
platform in question.

* int timer_get_real_time( timer_type *real_time )

Set the implementation-dependant time structure real_time to the current
time. Return zero on success and non-zero on error.

* float timer_get_time_difference( timer_type *a, timer_type *b )

Return a float representing the difference between the implementation-dependant
time structures a and b in seconds.

* void timer_add_time_difference( timer_type *a, long msec )

Add msec milliseconds to the implementation-dependant time structure a.

* void timer_sleep_ms( int ms )

Cause Fuse to go to sleep for the given number of milliseconds.
