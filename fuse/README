The Free Unix Spectrum Emulator (Fuse) 0.5.1
============================================

Given the current proliferation of DOS/Windows Speccy emulators, I
decided it was time to redress the Unix balance a bit. Therefore, here
is Fuse (the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator), version 0.5.1.

What Fuse does have:

* Working 16K/48K/128K/+2/+2A/+3 Speccy and Timex TC2048
  emulation, running at true Speccy speed on any computer you're
  likely to try it on.
* Support for loading from .tzx files.
* Sound (on systems supporting the Open Sound System, something
  like OpenBSD or Solaris's /dev/audio, or SDL).
* Kempston joystick emulation.
* Emulation of some of the printers you could attach to a Spectrum.
* Support for the new RZX input recording file format.

What Fuse doesn't have:

* Emulation of any other peripherals (bar the tape deck)
* ...

What you'll need to run Fuse:

* A version of Unix with any of X, svgalib, framebuffer or SDL support
  installed.  If you have GTK+, you'll get a nicer user interface under X.
* libspectrum: this is available from
  http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/spectrum/libspectrum.html
* If you want +3 support, you'll need John Elliott's lib765 installed;
  this is available from http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/Unix/LibDsk/
  If you also have libdsk (from the same location) installed, you'll also
  get support for extended .dsk files (see 'THE .DSK FORMAT' section in
  fuse(1) for more details on this).
* Other libraries will give you some extended functionality:
  * libpng: the ability to save screenshots
  * libxml2: the ability to load and save Fuse's current configuration
  * zlib: support for compressed RZX files

If you've used Fuse up to version 0.5.0, note that the external
utilities (tzxlist, etc) are now available separately from Fuse
itself. See http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/spectrum/fuse.html for
details.

Building Fuse
-------------

To compile Fuse (see below for OS X instructions):

$ ./configure

There are now some options you can give to configure; `configure
--help' will list them all, but the most important are:

--with-fb		Use the framebuffer interface, rather than GTK+.
--with-svgalib		Use the SVGAlib interface.
--without-gtk		Use the plain Xlib interface.

If glib is installed on your system, Fuse will use this for a couple
of things; however, it isn't necessary (unless you're using the GTK+
interface, as GTK+ depends on glib). If you're having problem with
your glib setup, you can use the `--without-glib' option to
`configure', which will use some simple replacement routines.

Another useful option is `--with-local-prefix=DIRECTORY' which allows
you to specify that you have some the the libraries needed by Fuse in
`<DIRECTORY>/lib' and the necessary header files in
`<DIRECTORY>/include'. If you specify the `--prefix' option to tell
Fuse to install itself somewhere other than in /usr/local, that
directory will automatically be searched as well.

Then just:

$ make

(or `gmake' if that's what GNU Make is called on your system)

and then

$ make install

if you want to place Fuse into the main directories on your system
(under /usr/local by default, although you can change this with the
--prefix argument to `configure'). You'll probably need to be root to
do this bit.

Once you've got Fuse configured and built, read the man page :-)

Building Fuse on OS X
---------------------

It is possible to build and run Fuse on OS X by using the native
Cocoa port by fredm@spamcop.net. This comes as a set of
ProjectBuilder projects for lib765, libdsk, libspectrum and fuse
itself.

Directly compiling the Unix version of Fuse on Mac OS X is
possible, but would require some porting (there are at least
issues with linking the getopt files).

Closing comments
----------------

If you have any bug reports, suggestions or (particularly
appreciated!) patches for Fuse, mail them to me at
pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org. For more general Speccy related discussions,
visit the Usenet group `comp.sys.sinclair', but do read the FAQ
( http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/cssfaq/index.html ) first!

Fuse has its own home page, which you can find at:

http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/spectrum/fuse.html

or the latest version should be available from the World of Spectrum
( http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ ) FTP site:

ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/emulators/unix/

Finally, if you're interested in working on Fuse, some documents which
may be useful (information on internals, etc) are in the hacking/
directory.
