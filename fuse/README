The Free Unix Spectrum Emulator (Fuse) 0.3.1
============================================

Given the current proliferation of DOS/Windows Speccy emulators, I
decided it was time to redress the Unix balance a bit. Therefore, here
is Fuse (the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator), version 0.3.1.

What Fuse does have:

* Working 48K/128K/+2/+2A Speccy emulation, running at true Speccy
  speed, at least on this PII-233.
* Sound (at least under Linux).

What Fuse doesn't have:

* Any sound output under operating systems other than Linux.
* A nice GUI.
* The ability to save to tape files
* Emulation of any peripherals (bar the tape deck)
* A keyboard picture, so you can find those keywords
* ...

What you'll need to run Fuse:

* A version of Un*x with either X or svgalib. If you have GTK+
  installed, you'll get a nicer user interface under X.

To compile Fuse:

$ ./configure

There are now some options you can give to configure; `configure
--help' will list them all, but the most important are:

--with-svgalib		Use the SVGAlib interface, rather than GTK+.
--without-gtk		Use the plain Xlib interface, rather than GTK+.
--enable-issue2		Emulate an Issue 2 Spectrum, rather than an Issue 3.

If glib is installed on your system, Fuse will use this for a couple
of things; however, it isn't necessary (unless you're using the GTK+
interface, as GTK+ depends on glib). If you're having problem with
your glib setup, you can use the `--without-glib' option to
`configure', which will use some simple replacement routines.

Then just:

$ make

To run fuse:

$ fuse [snapshot]

Not too difficult. You should then be presented with the familiar

`(c) 1982 Sinclair Research Ltd'

message, unless you gave a .z80 or .sna snapshot on the command line,
in which case you should get that instead. Numbers, letters, etc
should now work as they do on the Speccy (plus a few others eg
Backspace = CAPS + 0). Also:

 F2: Save snapshot (see below)
 F3: Load snapshot (see below)
 F5: Reset Spectrum
 F7: Rewind tape file to start
 F9: Switch between 48K/128K/+2/+2A emulation
F10: Quit Fuse

The snapshot loading is _very_ simple: it loads from a .z80 snapshot
(either 48K or 128K) called `snapshot.z80' in the current
directory. (If you need to convert your snaps to .z80, try SnapConv:
http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/spectrum/snapconv.html). Saving is
also to `snapshot.z80', and will happily overwrite any other file you
may have with that name.

The tape loading is also simple: it reads from a .tap file called
`tape.tap' in the current directory. Press F7 to rewind the tape
file to the start. Currently, only programs using the standard ROM
loader will work.

Fuse is copyrighted under the GNU General Public License (see the file
`COPYING' for details). However, note the GPL does *not* apply to the
Spectrum ROM files (`128-?.rom', `48.rom', `plus2-?.rom' and
`plus3-?.rom'), which are still copyrighted to Amstrad, although their
free distribution with emulators is permitted.

If you have any bug reports, suggestions or (particularly
appreciated!) patches for Fuse, mail them to me at
pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org. For more general Speccy related discussions,
visit the Usenet group `comp.sys.sinclair', but do read the FAQ
(http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/cssfaq/index.html) first!

Fuse has its own home page, which you can find at:

http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/spectrum/fuse.html

or the latest version should be available from the World of Spectrum
(http://www.worldofspectrum.org/) FTP site:

ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/emulators/unix/
