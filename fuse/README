The Free Unix Spectrum Emulator (Fuse) 0.4.2
============================================

Given the current proliferation of DOS/Windows Speccy emulators, I
decided it was time to redress the Unix balance a bit. Therefore, here
is Fuse (the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator), version 0.4.2.

What Fuse does have:

* Working 48K/128K/+2/+2A Speccy emulation, running at true Speccy
  speed on any computer you're likely to try it on (it runs at full
  speed on a SparcStation 4 unless you do too much graphics intensive
  stuff).
* Support for loading from .tzx files.
* Sound (on systems supporting the Open Sound System, or something
  like OpenBSD or Solaris's /dev/audio).
* Kempston joystick emulation.
* Emulation of some of the printers you could attach to a Spectrum.
* Very basic support for RZX files.

What Fuse doesn't have:

* Emulation of any other peripherals (bar the tape deck)
* ...

What you'll need to run Fuse:

* A version of Unix with either X or svgalib. If you have GTK+
  installed, you'll get a nicer user interface under X.

To compile Fuse:

$ ./configure

There are now some options you can give to configure; `configure
--help' will list them all, but the most important are:

--with-svgalib		Use the SVGAlib interface, rather than GTK+.
--without-gtk		Use the plain Xlib interface, rather than GTK+.

If glib is installed on your system, Fuse will use this for a couple
of things; however, it isn't necessary (unless you're using the GTK+
interface, as GTK+ depends on glib). If you're having problem with
your glib setup, you can use the `--without-glib' option to
`configure', which will use some simple replacement routines.

Then just:

$ make

(or `gmake' if that's what GNU Make is called on your system)

and then

$ make install

if you want to place Fuse into the main directories on your system
(under /usr/local by default, although you can change this with the
--prefix argument to `configure'). You'll probably need to be root to
do this bit.

Then, read the man page :-)

If you have any bug reports, suggestions or (particularly
appreciated!) patches for Fuse, mail them to me at
pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org. For more general Speccy related discussions,
visit the Usenet group `comp.sys.sinclair', but do read the FAQ
(http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/cssfaq/index.html) first!

Fuse has its own home page, which you can find at:

http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/spectrum/fuse.html

or the latest version should be available from the World of Spectrum
(http://www.worldofspectrum.org/) FTP site:

ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/emulators/unix/

Finally, if you're interested in working on Fuse, some documents which
may be useful (information on internals, etc) are in the hacking/
directory.
