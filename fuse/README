The Free Unix Spectrum Emulator (Fuse) 0.2.1
============================================

Given the current proliferation of DOS/Windows Speccy emulators, I
decided it was time to redress the Unix balance a bit. Therefore, here
is Fuse (the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator), version 0.2.1.

What Fuse does have:

* Working 48K/128K/+2/+2A Speccy emulation, running at true Speccy
  speed, at least on this PII-233.

What Fuse doesn't have:

* Any sound output
* A nice GUI. Or really any user interface at all!
* The ability to save to tape files
* Emulation of any peripherals (bar the tape deck)
* A keyboard picture, so you can find those keywords
* ...

What you'll need to run Fuse:

* A version of Un*x, with X and glib.

To compile Fuse:

$ ./configure
$ make

To run fuse:

$ fuse

Not too difficult. You should then be presented with the familiar

`(c) 1982 Sinclair Research Ltd'

message. Numbers, letters, etc should now work as they do on the
Speccy (plus a few others eg Backspace = CAPS + 0). Also:

 F2: Save snapshot (see below)
 F3: Load snapshot (see below)
 F5: Reset Spectrum
 F7: Rewind tape file to start
 F9: Switch between 48K/128K/+2/+2A emulation
F10: Quit Fuse

The snapshot loading is _very_ simple: it loads from a .sna snapshot
(either 48K or 128K) called `snapshot.sna' in the current
directory. (If you need to convert your snaps to .sna, try SnapConv:
http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~pak/spectrum/snapconv.html). Saving is also
to `snapshot.sna', and will happily overwrite any other file you may
have with that name.

The tape loading is also simple: it reads from a .tap file called
`tape.tap' in the current directory. Press F7 to rewind the tape
file to the start. Currently, only programs using the standard ROM
loader will work.

Fuse is copyrighted under the GNU General Public License (see the file
`COPYING' for details). However, note the GPL does *not* apply to the
Spectrum ROM files (`128-?.rom', `48.rom', `plus2-?.rom' and
`plus3-?.rom'), which are still copyrighted to Amstrad, although their
free distribution with emulators is permitted.

If you have any bug reports, suggestions or (particularly
appreciated!) patches for Fuse, mail them to me at
pak@ast.cam.ac.uk. For more general Speccy related discussions, visit
the Usenet group `comp.sys.sinclair', but do read the FAQ
(http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/cssfaq/index.html) first!

Fuse has its own home page, which you can find at:

http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pak21/spectrum/fuse.html

or the latest version should be available from the World of Spectrum
(http://www.void.jump.org/) FTP site:

ftp://ftp.void.jump.org/pub/sinclair/emulators/unix/
