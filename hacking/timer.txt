What you need to implement for Fuse's timing routines
=====================================================

Fuse's timing routines require three functions to be implemented;
those which return values should return zero on success and non-zero
on error.

* int timer_push( int msec, timer_function_type which )

Arrange for the action specified by 'which' to occur every 'msec'
milliseconds. 'timer_function_type' is defined in timer.h, and can
take the following values:

TIMER_FUNCTION_WAKE	Wake up if sleeping.
TIMER_FUNCTION_TICK	Wake up if sleeping and then call 'timer_tick'.

* int timer_pop( void )

Stop the action specified in the last call to 'timer_push' occuring.

* void timer_pause( void )

Cause Fuse to go to sleep until the next timer action occurs.
